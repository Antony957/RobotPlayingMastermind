# Robot Playing Mastermind

A polished README for the ME555: Intro to Robotics final project — Robot Playing Mastermind.

This repository contains code and assets for a two-player (and player-vs-robot) implementation of the Mastermind-like game where a robot physically picks and places colored pieces, and vision + language models help evaluate and/or choose guesses.


## Overview

Robot Playing Mastermind implements two gameplay modes:

**Mode 1 — PVP (Player vs Player)**

1. Player 1 chooses a secret color combination of four game pieces.
2. Player 2 controls the robot to pick colored pieces from boxes and place them into the guess slots.
3. After each placement, Player 1 announces:
    * how many colors are correct (regardless of position), and
    * how many pieces are in the correct positions.
    * The game continues until Player 2 correctly matches all 4 pieces (Player 2 wins), or Player 1 survives 10 rounds (Player 1 wins).

**Mode 2 — PVE (Player vs Environment / Robot)**

1. Player chooses a secret color combination of four game pieces.
2. The robot makes guesses (color + position) driven by analysis from the ChatGPT API.
3. A camera system (YOLO-based detector) inspects the robot’s placement and determines whether the guess is correct; the system feeds the results back for the next decision.


## Features

* Physical robot arm control for picking & placing colored pieces.
* Human-in-the-loop gameplay (PVP).
* Autonomous robot guessing using a ChatGPT-powered strategy (PVE).
* Visual verification using a YOLO object-detection model and camera.
